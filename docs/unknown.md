# Unknown intent

If the Chatbot doesn't understand what's typed: 

### :fontawesome-solid-robot:{: .grey } I'm sorry, I can only answer questions about:

>- User Groups
>- Business Capabilities
>- Processes
>- Applications

The user may be able to continue the previous conversation if a factsheet has been remembered, e.g. 

### :fontawesome-solid-user:{: .grey } types, "Show Children"

### :fontawesome-solid-robot:{: .grey } Choose a child of the User Group Headquarter:


But if a factsheet hasn't been remembered, an error may be shown, e.g.

### :fontawesome-solid-user:{: .grey } types, "Show Children"

### :fontawesome-solid-robot:{: .grey } You'll need to choose a factsheet before I can show its children


### :fontawesome-solid-robot:{: .grey } How can I help? I can answer questions about:

- User Groups
- Business Capabilities
- Processes
- Applications
